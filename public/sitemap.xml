  STATIC SITEMAP - CURRENTLY ACTIVE
  
  This static sitemap.xml is being served instead of src/app/sitemap.js
  because Next.js prioritizes static files over dynamic routes.
  
  CURRENT STATE:
  - Only homepage is included
  - Blog posts are NOT discoverable by search engines
  - Dynamic sitemap.js is ignored
  
  TO SWITCH TO DYNAMIC SITEMAP (when ready to make blog visible):
  1. Delete or rename this file (public/sitemap.xml)
  2. Restart Next.js dev server
  3. The dynamic sitemap will automatically include all blog posts
